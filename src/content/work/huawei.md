Contributed to Huawei's Ascend AI ecosystem by developing high-performance operators for deep learning workloads on Atlas series NPUs.

- Independently implemented various operators such as Log and Exp using AscendC, following SPMD programming model with Vector programming paradigm
- Adapted 10+ CV and NLP algorithms for Atlas 500 A2 and Atlas 300I Pro platforms, optimizing performance across multiple NPU architectures
- Integrated custom operators into PyTorch computational graph, accelerating both inference and training pipelines
